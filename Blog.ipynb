        "The collection and usage of personal medical and health data has  come under increased scrutiny recently with technology and medical development. Obviously, most medical scientists increasingly want patients to donate massive amounts of sensitivity personal information  for study such as  the complex sets of factors causing SCA and determing survival. However, privacy protection and ethical medical research become a big concern due to difficulties in data flow control with hidden network of patient data distribution by healthcare organizations and their third-party vendors. How to balance protecting patients' data with the benefits that big data brings to medical research becomes a popular topics and increase public attention.\n",

        "Receiving notice letter of data breach or spam call for asking payment of medical statement makes people scared and helpless. Recently, I received a notice letter of a data privacy incident involving Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau Inc. doing business as American Medical Collection Agency. The security compromise of company's payments page from an independent third-party compliance firms that works with credit card companies affected millions of Quest Diagnostics Inc. customers. Based on an external forensics review, that an unathourized user had access to companies system between August 1,2018 and March 30, 2019, and the personal information including first and last name, name of lab or medical service provider, data of medical service, referring doctor, certain other medical information was at a risk during the attack. This shocked news  bring me to more consideration and concern about my personal medical data and information. I had two questions on top of mind when I received this letter:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   What is this company (Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau Inc.)? I never gives the right to share any data with this company. After the reaserch online, I realize that my blood sample was sent to the medical lab by my HCP and this company collects receivalbes for medical labs. \n",
        "*  How do I prevent this data privacy incident in the future?\n",
        "\n",
        "When I was asked for blood test by my doctor, I lost autonomy to choose lab test company. What is worse, information is collected by third party agency without knowledge and consent. Without knowledge and autonomy, it is relatively hard to find these hidder layers of data distribution until the data breaches happen. \n",
